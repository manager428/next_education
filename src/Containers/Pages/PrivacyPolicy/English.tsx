              which pages you view and what you click on. Cookies assist our

              cookies can help us to remember your preferences, username,
              analyze the performance of our Platform and recommend content that
              may be most relevant to your interests.
            </p>
            Here are the reasons we may use cookies:

              <li>
                <i>Analytics.</i> This type of cookies shows us which pages
                users view, which links are popular, etc. These cookies only
                provide anonymized information that does not identify anybody
                personally. This information is then bundled with the similar
                information from the other users, so that we can analyze the

                necessary to enable users to navigate through the Platform and
                use its main features. E.g., essential cookies identify
                registered users so that they can access member-only areas of
                the site. Essential cookies keep users logged in. If a
                subscriber disables essential cookies, that subscriber won’t be

              California law requires that operators of online services disclose
              how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have
              incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when

              a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be
              tracked. At this time we do not respond to Do Not Track signal.
