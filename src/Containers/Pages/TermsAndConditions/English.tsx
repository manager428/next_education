            <h3>ACCEPTANCE</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of
              iDialogue.com (the “Site”) and/or iDialogue mobile application
              (the “App”). The Site and the App are collectively referred to
              herein as the “Platform.” IDIALOGUE INC. owns and operates this
              Platform out of Virginia, USA. These Terms have a force of a
              legally binding agreement, even if you are simply browsing without
              intention to contact us or register an account. The term "us,"
              "we" or "our" refers to the owners and operators of this Platform.
              The term "you" refers to the viewer of the Platform. Privacy
              Policy [insert link] is another important document that you should
              familiarize yourself with because it describes our practices with
              respect to your personal information. You cannot visit the
              Platform if you do not agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy.
              Sometimes we modify these Terms. We don’t notify users about every
              change to the Terms but you can see the date of the last update at
              the top of this page. If you still wish to visit the Platform
              after said date, that constitutes your agreement to the updates.
